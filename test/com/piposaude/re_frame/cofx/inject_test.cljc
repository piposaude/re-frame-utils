  "Simple test to verify subscription injection.

  - The app-db contains a seq of numbers.

  - We create a sub that takes an optional limit argument returning all or n
  numbers.

  - We create a an event-fx where we inject the numbers sub, sum the elements
  and write the sum out to the db.

  - We assert that the sum is correct.

  What we want to highlight is that when passing a fn to the cofx we're able to
  parametrize the injected subscription as well. In this case we pass a limit to
  the sum event handler, limit gets picked up by the cofx and the value of the
  numbers sub contains a limited range of numbers."
